Wolf Keyboard
=============

A swipe-focused keyboard for Android. The main reason for existence is
that it uses a non-QWERTY layout with the vowels in the center to
provide better ergonomics for swipe input.

This is a fork of
[Peter Eastman's Flow Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enchantedcode.flow)
([source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flowkeyboard/)).

New features:

* haptic feedback (vibration)
* moved to gradle build system
* additional special characters (e.g. backtick (`))

Original Flow feature list:

* Enter each word in a single gesture (similar to Swype or SlideIT). Touch the first letter, move your finger smoothly from one key to the next, and lift it when you reach the end of the word. Spaces between words are inserted automatically.
* The keyboard layout is optimized by analyzing common patterns in English words. The QWERTY layout used by most keyboards was designed for typing with two hands, and it's a terrible layout for on-screen use. The Flow layout is optimized so common words can be entered with the shortest, smoothest path possible.
* Keys are large and evenly spaced for improved accuracy.
* The most common punctuation symbols are directly available without needing a modifier key.
* Double letters are recognized automatically. You don't need to "scribble over" them like with Swype.
* When a word is recognized, it flashes briefly on top of the keyboard. You don't need to move your eyes away from the keyboard to verify it.
* Long-press any key for a selection of alternate characters.
* Supports voice input.
* Supports English (American and British), French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.
