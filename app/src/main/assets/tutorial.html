The Flow keyboard layout is very different from the QWERTY layout you are probably familiar with.  It is a very logical
layout, though, and understanding the logic behind it is the key to learning it quickly.  It is designed with one
guiding principle in mind: <i>allow common English words to be traced with the shortest, smoothest path possible</i>.
<p/>
All the vowels are grouped together in the middle of the keyboard.  That's what you would expect, since almost every
word contains vowels, and they are among the most common letters in the English language.  They are also drawn in a
different color to make them easier to see:
<p align="center" style="background: url('layout.png'); background-size: 100%"><img src="maskVowels.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>
Try typing all of the vowels into this box:
<p/>
<table><tr><td><b>Enter:</b><br>aeiou</td><td style="width: 100%"><textarea rows="1" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Another important group of letters are found in the second row.  They spell the word "therm":
<p align="center" style="background: url('layout.png'); background-size: 100%"><img src="maskTherm.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>
A therm is a unit of heat, and these are very "hot" letters.  For example, "the" is the most common 3-letter sequence
in English, and "her" is the fourth most common.
<p/>
Try typing the following words, which use only these letters.  To type a word, touch the first letter.  Without lifting
your finger, move it to the second letter, then to the third letter, and so on.  Once you reach the last letter in the
word, lift your finger.  Flow will add spaces between words automatically.
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>the he her them me hem</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Taken together, the letters in this row plus the vowels account for over 60% of all letters in English.  Try typing the
following words:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>that more heart reheat hour mite route item</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Another very important letter sequence is "ing".  In fact, this is the third most common 3-letter sequence in English.
No surprise, then, that Flow places these letters right together, all arranged in a column:
<p align="center" style="background: url('layout.png'); background-size: 100%"><img src="maskIng.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>
Try typing the following words:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>thing ring ingot hearing training arranging grain range</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Don't worry about the double r in "arranging".  Just move your finger from a to r, and then on to the next letter.  Flow
will figure out that it needs to be a double letter.
<p/>
"Th" is the most common 2-letter sequence in English, and as you've seen, Flow puts these letters right next to each
other.  "Sh", "ch", and "wh" are also common sequences, so it's no surprise that s, c, and w are all close to h:
<p align="center" style="background: url('layout.png'); background-size: 100%"><img src="maskSCWH.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>
Try typing some words that use these letters:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>what chess she short who where much wishing which</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Another common letter sequence is "ld":
<p align="center" style="background: url('layout.png'); background-size: 100%"><img src="maskLd.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>
Try typing some words that use this sequence:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>would could sold holding cold</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Taken together, the letters you have learned so far account for almost 90% of all letters in English.  Try typing these
words:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>sun old real nice air ice house shore mound</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Here are some longer words.  If you don't remember where the next letter is, just pause a moment and think which group
it's part of.
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>welcome candle treasure singer creation tradition accident</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
This leaves the less commonly used letters.  They are arranged around the outside edge of the keyboard:
<p align="center" style="background: url('layout.png'); background-size: 100%"><img src="maskOther.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>
As much as possible, their positions still reflect how they are used.  For example, q is close to u, which almost always
follows it.  K is next to c, since it often appears as part of the sequence "ck".  Y is above the letters o and u, so
the common letter sequence "you" forms a straight line down a column.
<p/>
Try typing these words:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>by very plank exact quick fun just zoo young cake</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Here are some longer words:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>please fumble quavery express juxtapose bookshop</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
There is one more "letter" we haven't talked about: apostrophe.  It isn't really a letter, of course, but it can still
appear in words, and Flow knows many common contractions.
<p align="center" style="background: url('layout.png'); background-size: 100%"><img src="maskApostrophe.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>
To enter a contraction, just trace through the apostrophe key like any other letter.  Try typing these words:
<p/>
<table><tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Enter:</b><br>he's I'm I'll it's can't won't wouldn't we've that's they're</td><td style="width: 50%"><textarea rows="3" style="width: 100%"></textarea></td></tr></table>
<p/>
Flow does <i>not</i> recognize possessives: words like "Bob's", "Sally's", "dog's", "cat's", etc.  To enter a
possessive, enter the word without the 's, lift your finger, then press ' and s as two separate keys.
<p/>
You're all ready to start using Flow!  To really become comfortable with the layout, you just need to practice.
